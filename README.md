- To run the RT model `python rt.py`.
- There are no special dependencies, the code should work if you have numpy, matplotlib, scipy.
- All the RT related stuff are in rt.py. 
- The function names should be self explanatory.
- Critical functions are:
    - `initialize`
    - `calc_viscous_flux`
    - `calc_source`
    - `set_bc`
    - `calc_primvars`
- You can use `python plot.py` to plot the solution as soon as one data file is written (After 10000 iterations, which can be set on line 343 of rt.py).
